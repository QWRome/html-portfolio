<h1> The Best Movies according to Rose.</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>Baddhai Do</h3>
<p>It is Indian.</p>

<h3>Where the Crawdads Sing</h3>
<p>It is a movie that shows the way the world can snuff out an innocent light. It has the ability to move you and make you drop your moral bearings for a moment in favour of a greater justice. </p>

<h3>Arcane</h3>
<p>It is an amazing animated film that tells a great story. It's graphics and storytelling are out of this world.</p>
